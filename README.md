## History

Gaining access to specific doors in a secure building by using your own fingerprint. This was a school project many many years ago. Expect some funny shortcut and not so optimized code in various places :see_no_evil:. Please do not use this project anywhere near a production environment!

## Creators

Made by [Rob op den Kelder](https://github.com/Kelderro) and [Stephan Klop](https://github.com/Klopperz) both working for "HolyWest" at the time.
